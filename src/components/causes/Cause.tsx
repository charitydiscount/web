                        <p>Recently, the US Federal government banned online casinos from operating in America by making
                            it illegal to transfer
                            money to them through any US bank or payment system. As a result of this law, most of the
                            popular online casino networks
                            such as Party Gaming and PlayTech left the United States. Overnight, online casino players
                            found themselves being
                            chased by the Federal government. But, after a fortnight, the online casino industry came up
                            with a solution and new
                            online casinos started taking root. These began to operate under a different business
                            umbrella, and by doing that,
                            rendered the transfer of money to and from them legal. A major part of this was enlisting
                            electronic banking systems
                            that would accept this new clarification and start doing business with me. Listed in this
                            article are the electronic
                            banking systems that accept players from the United States that wish to play in online
                            casinos.</p>
